I am completely new to this. I have tried doing some part which I was able to do it on my own and have also taken some help from youtube tutorials (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBf0hzazHTGOIn_vuuuCzRFVhYiDBnJID ) as well. 

Level 0 
Log into the game using SSH to the given server. 
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Username and Password : bandit0, Once Logged in the level 0 is completed.


Level 1
" ls " command is used which lists all the files present. readme file is shown after the use of ls command. 
Now we use a " cat readme " command that displays the password in the form of string stored in readme. Using this password we login into bandit1 using ssh
" ssh bandit1@bandit,overthewire.org -p 2220 "
Enter the password found above in the readme file. 

Level 2
Now after we login into bandit1, we have our password stored in a file called - .
" ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
1st we use ls command to list the - file.
2nd we use the cat command to display the string present in the - file. 
(but for - file we write the command as follows cat ./- )
Logout of bandit1
" exit " command is used. 

Level 3
Login into bandit2, whose password we have got from the - file. 
" ssh bandit2@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
use " ls -all " command to list all the files, where we will find spaces in this filename.
use " cat 'spaces in this filename' " ((when the name of file has multiple word use '' ))
Now we got the password for level 4, so we logout of bandit2.


Level 4
Login into bandit3 using the above found password.
" ssh bandit3@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
" ls -all " , after using this we see inhere directory
Now we use " cd inhere " for shwing the content present in a directory.
Inside of whcih we find a .hidden file whcih has our required password. 
" cat .hidden " 
"exit"
