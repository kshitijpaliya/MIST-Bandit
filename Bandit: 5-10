Level 5
Using password that we got in Level 4, we login as bandit4
" ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
I was stuck at this level as I was not able to understand what to do after listing all the files in the inhere directory i.e. I didnt understood what it meant by human readable file. SO here i took the help from youtube tutorial.
" find . -type f | xargs file "
So we get a file Which contains ASCII text i.e. human readable text. 
" cat ./-file07 "
Use this password to lgin into next level. 
"exit"
