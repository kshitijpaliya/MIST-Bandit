Level 5
Using password that we got in Level 4, we login as bandit4
" ssh bandit4@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
I was stuck at this level as I was not able to understand what to do after listing all the files in the inhere directory i.e. I didnt understood what it meant by human readable file. SO here i took the help from youtube tutorial.
" find . -type f | xargs file "  (f=files)
So we get a file Which contains ASCII text i.e. human readable text. 
" cat ./-file07 "
Use this password to lgin into next level. 
"exit"

Level 6
lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR is the password for Level 6, login into bandit5 using this.
" ssh bandit5@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
I was again stuck here, so I took help from the youtube tutorial.
" ls ": lists the inhere directory 
" cd inhere " 
" find . -type f -size 1033c ! -executable " : is the command used according to the conditions given in the level.

Level 7
P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU is the password for Level 7, login into bandit6 using this.
" ssh bandit6@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
The next command used was - 
" find / -type f -use bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c "
Look for the .password file in the list that pops up. 
/var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password
cat this file to get the password for the next level. 
" cat /var/lib/dpkg/info/bandit7.password "

Level 8
z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S is the password for Level 8, login into bandit7 using this.
" ssh bandit7@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
" ls -all "
" cat data.txt " shows a larger number of strings that are present in there.
So we need to find the string for millionth whcih is our password for next level.
For this we use grep command (which searches a string in a group of files).
" strings data.txt | grep "millionth" "
We ge the string millionth which has our password for the next level.

Level 9
TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP is the password for Level 9, login into bandit8 using this.
" ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 "
" ls -all "
" cat data.txt "
Then we use the sort command which sorts the data.
" sort data.txt "
But we need the text which has appeared on;y once. For which we use the " uniq " command which omits the repeated line and "uniq -c" (c=count) will show us the number of times that line appeatred, where we find the text which appeared only once.
" sort data.txt | uniq -c "
